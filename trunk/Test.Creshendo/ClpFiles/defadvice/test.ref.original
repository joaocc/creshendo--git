Testing defadvice:
*** defadvice before a single function:
2 and 2 is 5?
*** undefadvice before a single function:
2 and 2 is actually 4
*** defadvice before with short-circuit:
2 and 2 is 1?
No, 2 and 2 is really 4
*** defadvice after:
2 and 2 is 5?
No, 2 and 2 is really 4
*** defadvice group:
arithmetic: 2 and 2 is 4
arithmetic: 2 times 2 is 4
arithmetic: 2 minus 2 is 0
arithmetic: 2 over 2 is 1.0
*** undefadvice group:
2 and 2 is 4
2 times 2 is 4
2 minus 2 is 0
2 over 2 is 1.0
Test done.
