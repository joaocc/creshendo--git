Testing backwards chaining in deftemplates:
( Calculating the factorial of 12... )
( Calculating the factorial of 10... )
The factorial of 12 is 479001600, and of 10 is 3628800, and of 5 is 120
The factorial of 12 is 479001600, and of 10 is 3628800
The factorial of 10 is 3628800
Test part 1 done.
