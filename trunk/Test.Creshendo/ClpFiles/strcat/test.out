Testing str-cat :
x is 0
increment of x is 2nd argument to str-cat
incr x by 1 results in 1
incr x by 1 results in 2
incr x by 1 results in 3
incr x by 1 results in 4
Set x back to 0
increment of x is 1st argument to str-cat
1 is value of x after incr by 1
2 is value of x after incr by 1
3 is value of x after incr by 1
4 is value of x after incr by 1
Test done.
